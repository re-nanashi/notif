# 🚀 notif: Order Notification System

* **Problem:** Small businesses in the Philippines struggle to update customers on made-to-order products (cakes, tailoring, furniture, events, etc.). Manual updates via Messenger or SMS are time-consuming and prone to errors.
* **Solution:** A SaaS platform that automates **order notifications** (Messenger-first, with email/SMS optional). Customers receive real-time updates in the same channel they ordered from, reducing stress and building trust.
